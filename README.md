## Windows Installation

### Install as Service

```bash
3proxy --install
```

Installs and starts proxy as Windows service (config file should be located in the same directory).

### Remove Service

```bash
3proxy --remove
```

Removes the service (should be stopped before via `net stop 3proxy`).

## Linux Installation

### Build from Source

1. Install git and build-essential packages:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/z3apa3a/3proxy
cd 3proxy
ln -s Makefile.Linux Makefile
make
sudo make install
```

### Default Configuration (for Linux/Unix)

3proxy uses 2 configuration files:

- `/etc/3proxy/3proxy.cfg` (before-chroot) - This configuration file is executed before chroot and should not be modified.
- `/usr/local/3proxy/conf/3proxy.cfg` symlinked from `/etc/3proxy/conf/3proxy.cfg` (after-chroot) - This is the main configuration file. Modify this file, if required.

All paths in `/usr/local/3proxy/conf/3proxy.cfg` are relative to chroot directory (`/usr/local/3proxy`). For future versions it's planned to move 3proxy chroot directory to `/var`.

Log files are created in `/usr/local/3proxy/logs` symlinked from `/var/log/3proxy`.

By default, socks is started on `0.0.0.0:1080` and proxy on `0.0.0.0:3128` with basic auth, no users are added by default.

### Adding Users

Use `/etc/3proxy/conf/add3proxyuser.sh` script to add users:

```bash
/etc/3proxy/conf/add3proxyuser.sh username password [day_limit] [bandwidth]
```

- `day_limit` - traffic limit in MB per day
- `bandwidth` - bandwidth in bits per second (1048576 = 1Mbps)

Or modify `/etc/3proxy/conf/` files directly.

## MacOS X / FreeBSD / *BSD Installation

```bash
git clone https://github.com/z3apa3a/3proxy
cd 3proxy
ln -s Makefile.FreeBSD Makefile
make
```

Binaries are in `bin/` directory.

- SMTP proxy
- Threaded application (no child process)
- Web administration and statistics
- Plugins for functionality extension

### 2. Proxy Chaining and Network Connections

- Can be used as a bridge between client and different proxy type (e.g. convert incoming HTTP proxy request from client to SOCKSv5 request to parent server)
- Connect back proxy support to bypass firewalls
- Parent proxy support for any type of incoming connection
- Username/password authentication for parent proxy(s)
- HTTPS/SOCKS4/SOCKS5 and ip/port redirection parent support
- Random parent selection
- Chain building (multihop proxing)
- Load balancing between few network connections by choosing network interface

### 3. Logging

- Tuneable log format compatible with any log parser
- stdout logging
- file logging
- syslog logging (Unix)
- ODBC logging
- RADIUS accounting
- log file rotation
- automatic log file processing with external archiver (for files)
- Character filtering for log files
- Different log files for different services are supported

### 4. Access Control

- ACL-driven Access control by username, source IP, destination IP/hostname, destination port and destination action (POST, PUT, GET, etc), weekday and daytime
- ACL-driven (user/source/destination/protocol/weekday/daytime or combined) bandwidth limitation for incoming and (!)outgoing traffic
- ACL-driven traffic limitation per day, week or month for incoming and outgoing traffic
- Connection limitation and rate limiting
- User authentication by username / password
- RADIUS Authentication and Authorization
- User authentication by DNS hostname
- Authentication cache with possibility to limit user to single IP address
- Access control by username/password for SOCKSv5 and HTTP/HTTPS/FTP
- Cleartext or encrypted (crypt/MD5 or NT) passwords
- Connection redirection
- Access control by requested action (CONNECT/BIND, HTTP GET/POST/PUT/HEAD/OTHER)
- All access control entries now support weekday and time limitations
- Hostnames and * templates are supported instead of IP address

### 5. Extensions

## Utilities

### 3proxy

Combined proxy server may be used as executable or service (supports installation and removal). It uses config file to read it's configuration (see `3proxy.cfg.sample` for details). `3proxy.exe` is all-in-one, it doesn't require all others .exe to work.

See `3proxy.cfg.sample` for examples, see `man 3proxy.cfg`

### proxy

HTTP proxy server, binds to port 3128

### ftppr

FTP proxy server, binds to port 21. Please do not mess it with FTP over HTTP proxy used in browsers.

### socks

SOCKS 4/5 proxy server, binds to port 1080

### pop3p

POP3 proxy server, binds to port 110. You must specify POP3 username as `username@target.host.ip[:port]`. Port is 110 by default.

**Example:** In Username configuration for your e-mail reader, set `someuser@pop.example.org`, to obtain mail for `someuser` from `pop.somehost.ru` via proxy.

### smtpp

SMTP proxy server, binds to port 25. You must specify SMTP username as `username@target.host.ip[:port]`. Port is 25 by default.

**Example:** In Username configuration for your e-mail reader, set `someuser@mail.example.org`, to send mail as `someuser` via `mail.somehost.ru` via proxy.

### tcppm

TCP port mapping. Maps some TCP port on local machine to TCP port on remote host.

### tlspr

TLS proxy (SNI proxy) - sniffs hostname from TLS handshake

### udppm

UDP port mapping. Maps some UDP port on local machine to UDP port on remote machine. Only one user simultaneously can use UDP mapping, so it can't be used for public service in large networks. It's OK to use it to map to DNS server in small network or to map Counter-Strike server for single client (you can use few mappings on different ports for different clients in last case).

### mycrypt

Program to obtain crypted password from cleartext. Supports both MD5/crypt and NT password.

**Usage:**

```bash
# Generate NT password
mycrypt password
# Output: NT:BD7DFBF29A93F93C63CB84790DA00E63

# Generate MD5/crypt password with salt
mycrypt salt password
# Output: CR:$1$salt$hashedpassword
```
